## Project Overview

In this GitHub repository, you'll find an HR dashboard project created using Power BI. The dashboard is designed to offer insights into HR-related data, including employee statistics, promotion eligibility, job levels, distance status, service years, and more.

## Dashboard Overview

The HR dashboard encompasses the following key components:

1. **Total Employee Statistics:** This section provides an overview of the total number of employees, as well as the distribution between men and women. It also highlights employees who are due for promotion and those who are not eligible for promotion.

2. **Employee Metrics by Job Level:** This section breaks down the total number of employees by job level, allowing for a detailed analysis of distribution among different roles within the organization.

3. **Employee Metrics by Distance Status:** This section offers insights into the distribution of employees based on their distance status (e.g., in-office, remote, hybrid).

4. **Service Years Analysis:** It provides a visualization of service years, helping identify the length of service for various employees.

5. **Service Years vs. Layoff Analysis:** This section explores the relationship between service years and the likelihood of being laid off.
